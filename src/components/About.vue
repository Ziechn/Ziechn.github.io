    Software Developer - Dad - Artist - Gamer - Spaghetti Thrower
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>In a nutshell</h3>
    <h2>Creative, self-managed, Dad</h2>
    <p>
      I have a diverse background spanning customer service, graphic design, print, video production, music, and web design.
      You could say that I have been throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for most part, I have been an artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time at FedEx Office, I had the opportunity to apply my logical problem-solving skills by building a fulfillment solution.
      I collaborated with my team to create complex Excel formulas, develop and maintain an automation tool, and design a web-based order
      management application with the corporate development team. This experience helped me build confidence in my technical abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2019, feeling the need for a new direction, I started exploring new career paths.
      After extensive discussions with friends and colleagues, I decided to move beyond the "artist" label and began developing my first game project in Unity.
      I chose Unity because I believed programming in C# would be highly transferable. It was then that I discovered my true passion: solving problems with code.
      Over the next four years, I worked on this project, honing my skills and building the confidence needed for the next big step.
    </p>
    <p>
      In February 2024, I took the leap and left my job of 12 years to attend the Tech Elevator Java programming bootcamp, fully committing to a career in tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      While my two children are my greatest achievements, now I am focused on creating my next great achievement.
