    Software Developer - Dad - Artist - Gamer - Spaghetti Thrower
  </p>
  <div class="section">
    <h3>In a nutshell</h3>
    <h2>Creative, self-managed, Dad.</h2>
    <p>
      A background in customer service, graphic design, print, video production, music, web design, etc. You could say
      that I have been throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for most part, I have been an artist. During my time at FedEx Office, I was given the opportunity to flex my
      logical problem solving muscles when as I was tasked with building a fulfillment solution. I worked with my team
      to create complex excel formulas, develop and maintain an automation tool, and worked with the corporate
      development team to design a web based order management application. All while building confidence in my technical
      abilities...
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2019, I felt like I needed to do something more. I spent most of the year talking with friends and colleagues
      about how to proceed. In November of that year, I dropped the exclusive "artist" label and began developing my
      first game project in Unity. I chose Unity because I felt like programming in C# would be the most transferrable.
      That was when I found what I was meant to be doing: solving problems with code. For 4 years I continued working on
      that project, building the skills and confidence to make my next big jump...
    </p>
    <p>
      I did it! I took the leap and left my job of 12 years in February, 2024 to attend the Tech Elevator Java
      programming bootcamp. Pursuing my career in tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      My 2 kids are my two greatest achievements, but I am now working towards creating my next one.
