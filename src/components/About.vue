          I have a diverse background spanning customer service, graphic design, print, video production, music, and
          web
          design.
          You could say that I have been throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for most part, I have been an artist.

          During my time at FedEx Office, I had the opportunity to apply my logical problem-solving skills by building
          a
          fulfillment solution.
          I collaborated with my team to create complex Excel formulas, develop and maintain an automation tool, and
          design a web-based order
          management application with the corporate development team. This experience helped me build confidence in my
          technical abilities.

          In 2019, feeling the need for a new direction, I started exploring new career paths.
          After extensive discussions with friends and colleagues, I decided to move beyond the "artist" label and
          began
          developing my first game project in Unity.
          I chose Unity because I believed programming in C# would be highly transferable. It was then that I
          discovered
          my true passion: solving problems with code.
          Over the next four years, I worked on this project, honing my skills and building the confidence needed for
          the
          next big step.
        </p>
        <p>
          In February 2024, I took the leap and left my job of 12 years to attend the Tech Elevator Java programming
          bootcamp, fully committing to a career in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my two children are my greatest achievements, now I am focused on creating my next great achievement.
