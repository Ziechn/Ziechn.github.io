                After our bootcamp ended, one of my classmates asked for help fixing our first capstone project.
                I thought it would be fun to turn this into a full event for my friends.
                So, I hosted a Discord event where I guided everyone through updating our original code and building the vending machine full-stack application.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app incorporates many of the techniques we learned during our bootcamp, including a PostgreSQL server,
                a Java/Spring Boot backend using REST and JDBC templates, endpoint testing with Postman, and a front-end built with Vue.js,
                utilizing the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <h4>Java | Springboot | PostgreSQL | Postman | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Vue.js | Axios | External APIs |
                RESTful API | JDBC</h4>
