                After our bootcamp ended, one of my classmates asked for help fixing our first capstone project
                together.
                I thought it would be fun to help get that working while turning it into a full event for my friends.
                I hosted a Discord event to help walk through how to update our original code, as well building the
                vending machine full stack application.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app features most of the techniques we learned during our bootcamp. A PostgreSQL server, a Java /
                Springboot backend, utilizing the REST and JDBC templates, testing endpoints with Postman, and building
                a front-end with Vue.js with the fundamentals we learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            </p>
            <h4>Java | Springboot | PostgreSQL | Postman | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Vue.js | Axios | External APIs |
                RESTful API | JDBC</h4>
