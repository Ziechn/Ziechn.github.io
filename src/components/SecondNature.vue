            <p>NominEat is a restaurant selection service where you, as an event organizer, selects a number of
                restaurants for
                your friends to vote on. To make selecting a restaurant to eat much easier.</p>
            <p>NominEat was a group project for our final capstone while I was attending the Tech Elevator bootcamp. I
                helped to
                design the database, write the backend code using a Java Springboot server, as well as assisted with the
                front end
                using Vue.js and axios.</p>

                RESTful API | JDBC</h4>
