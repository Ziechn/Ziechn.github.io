            <p>Hit the Deck Racing - Mobile is a personal passion project of mine. I wanted to lean how to program and
                started
                with an ambitious project while I leanred a number of tools to make games.
                Built within the Unity game engine, written in C# using object orientent programing standards. As well
                as
                count
                less other tool to make assets such as Blender 3D for 3D assets, Procreate and Krita for textures and
                images, and
                various other tools.
